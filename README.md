# Matrix Determinant Gauss
Calculate a given or random NxN matrix determinant using Gauss's algorithm.

# About 
This program uses a simple implementation of Gauss's algorithm to calculate the determinant of a given NxN matrix by transaforming it into an upper triangular matrix using Gauss's elementary operations, and then calculating the product of the diagonal elements.
